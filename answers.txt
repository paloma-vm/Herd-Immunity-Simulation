1. What were the inputs you gave the simulation? 
(Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)

(10000, 0.25, Seasonal Flu, 0.001, 2.6)

2.What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
3.What percentage of the population died from the virus?
4.Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, 
how many times, in total, did a vaccination save someone from potentially becoming infected?
